	<p></p>
	<img src="figs/latte-sketch.png" alt="pr" width="500">
	    <br>
	<p>
		- ceremony, providence, rhode island, usa. easily the best strawberry matcha (made with real fruit, making it not gross and syrupy like strawberry drinks tend to be) and good regular oat lattes. pretty much anything on the menu is excellent!
	</p> 
	    
	<p>
		- seven sisters, providence, rhode island, usa. oat lattes are great!
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- daves coffee, providence, rhode island, usa. the "coffee milk latte" is a classic rhode island-er drink but also a regular latte is very good! also excellent breakfast sandwiches and avocado toasts and baked goods.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- bolt coffee, providence, rhode island, usa. really good espresso and matcha lattes. bonus point that one of the locations is inside the risd museum for a cool and cultural art experience.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		 - little city coffee, providence, rhode island, usa. tiny little coffeeshop with very good espresso lattes and baked goods! fun fact is that this was opened by dave (from above)'s very own brother. potentially because of some family dispute in classic provdence restaurant business style.
	</p>

	<p>
		- small format, providence, rhode island, usa. giant pride flag flying at the entrance and always a good source of fun events in the city. lattes always seasonally themed and very good breakfast sandwiches!

	</p>


	<p> </p>
	<br>
	    
	<p>
		- tatte, boston, massachussetts, usa. the house latte is a middle-eastern inspired cardamom-y cinnamon-y warmly spiced latte, that even if a little too sweet for my liking, i highly recommend trying.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- blue bottle. [san francisco, la, san diego, dc, boston], usa. becoming a fairly popular chain, but very good quality espresso and lattes! also the chocolate-based drinks are surprisingly dark and intense and very very good.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- ogawa, boston, massachussetts, usa. impressive latte art, excellent matcha and the chocolate-based drinks (mocha, hot chocolate etc) are what everyone talks about. everything very good in general!
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- the well, boston, massachussetts, usa. tiny little nonprofit cafe with very good lattes!
	</p>
	    
	    
	<p> </p>
	<br>

	    	<p> 
- the moon, lincoln, new hampshire. our post-hike pick-me-up and everything (including baked goods) is so good. we are biased after a long day of franconia hiking or whatever though.
			
		</p>


	    
	<p> </p>
	<br>


	    	<p> 
- the coffee bar, lake placid, new york. good lattes and is placed, basically, right on lake placid which during winter is frozen which means you view the occasional dog sled or ice skater whiz past you as you sip your coffee. so fun!
			
		</p>

	    	<p> 
- original coffee, lake placid, new york. excellent espresso lattes and hot chocolate (it was cold and wintry and this felt like the clear thing to order). recommend!
			
		</p>
	    


	<p> </p>
	<br>

	    	<p> 
- stumptown coffee roasters, new york city, new york. first knew them because of their nitro/cold brew cans but the coffeeshop is so great! really good nitro and espresso lattes.
			
		</p>

	    	<p> 
- intelligentsia, new york city, new york. impressive range of coffee making gear and everything is always very good! if you go there after normal coffee-drinking hours it also has a great selection of wine.
			
		</p>

	    	<p> 
- starbucks reserve, new york city, new york. i know, it's a starbucks, but this one is always fun to walk through and the quality of lattes is a definite step up from regular sbucks!
			
		</p>
	    

	<p> </p>
	<br>


	    	<p> 
- tandem, portland, maine. very aesthetically served and good lattes.
			
		</p>

	    	<p> 
- the proper cup, portland, maine. feminist and queer-themed art all around and excellent coffee and baked items.
			
		</p>
	    

	<p> </p>
	<br>
	    
	    
	<p>
		- golden goat, san francisco, california, usa. the golden turmeric latte is their famous thing to get (that i did not get because i cannot get myself to drink turmeric) but a normal espresso latte here is excellent. nick tomlin's rec!
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- philz, [san francisco, davis, mtv, boston], usa. i know this is a chain but philz is actually so good! the mint mojito is excellent if you can stomach something sweet, and the mocha tesora is a really great dark mocha. a regular iced/hot latte is also always good!
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- four barrel coffee, san francisco, california. usa. really good quality lattes! the decor is very plant themed which is fun to be in.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- pachamama, davis, california, usa. coffee beans from smallholder coffee farms and (often) latin american inspired drinks and such good lattes overall! always fun/interesting seasonal specials.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
		- mishkas, davis, california, usa. impressively large selection of lattes and drip coffee (just a regular is very good though) and a selection of baked goods that are usually pretty good. plus a gelato store right next door!
	</p>


	    	<p>
- looney bean, mammoth, california. such an adorable little place with *hilarious* signage about their exasperation with the skiiers that come into their store. really good lattes!
			
		</p>
	    
	    	<p>
- mammoth coffee roasting, mammoth, california. excellent latte art and quality espresso.
			
		</p>
	    
	    	<p>
- top dog, morro bay, california. part of a local shelter/dog rescue company that everything in the shop is themed around. adds to the vibe! and very good espresso lattes.
			
		</p>

	    	<p>
- scour, morro bay, california. a very spicy mexican latte, but very good matcha lattes too.
			
		</p>
	    
	    	<p>
- verve, santa cruz, california. a chain, but quality coffee! matcha latte is very good and lots of fun seasonal specials.
			
		</p>
	    
	    	<p>
- cat and cloud, santa cruz, california. allegedly a cat cafe (which i am usually not a fan of) but we did not actually see any cats, whew, and the coffee was very good!
			
		</p>

	    
	<p></p>

	    <br>

	<p>
		- cypress creek, wimberley, texas. weirdly aesthetic and ceremony-like (right in the middle of wimbo!) and excellent iced lattes.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		- blanco brew, wimberley, texas. very good lattes and baked goods. you can also add a shot of bourbon to any drink you want...
		
	</p>


	    
	<p> </p>
	<br>
	    
	<p>
		- ozo coffee, boulder, colorado, usa. really good matcha and espresso lattes, and, if you sit outisde, you get rewarded with a view of the flatirons!
	</p>
	<p>
		- boxcar coffee, boulder, colorado, usa. great lattes plus mountains through the windows.
	</p>
	<p>
		- roothouse coffee, pagosa springs, colorado, usa. excellent lattes, cinnamon buns, and rustic log-cabin-y vibes. plus if you sit on the deck outside it overlooks the hotsprings and the rockies behind so you really could not ask for a better view or coffee experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		- raisin rye, del norte, colorado, usa. such good lattes and every baked good looked incredible! mary's recommendation (these never fail us, really).
	</p>
	<p></p>

	<p> </p>
	<br>

	    
	<p>
		- frequency, london, uk. good quality espresso and latte making! the second location (in angel) also has very good baked goods.
	</p>
	<p>
		- jolene, london, uk. the tiniest little store with only a small seelction of baked goods laid out on a table to grab and excellent lattes!
	</p>
	<p>
		- ozone, london uk. such good quality lattes! been told that the chai latte is also excellent.
	</p>
	<p>
		- kiss the hippo, london, uk. tiny little cart by the canal but very good coffee. they also have the coolest merch, largely because everything is hippopotamus themed and therefore impossible to not be adorable.
	</p>
	<p>
		- hermanos, london, uk. i didn't realise this was a chain and started to really like getting their lattes everytime i was freezing/walking back home. so i will keep this one here in solidarity of great coffee and that one barista that i now know really well.
	</p>
	<p>
		- redemption roasters, london, uk. really good espresso and cool history of the place and hires.
	</p>

	<p>
		- knoops, london, uk. mostly hot chocolate, in any minute percentage you want (!!), but you can also get mochas and lattes that are all excellent.
	</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>
		- the box, stroud, lake district, uk. tiny little boxcar that pulls up with an impressive espresso making collection. such good lattes!
	</p>

	<p>
		- cargo coffee, cornwall, uk. a giant cargo truck converted into a coffeeshop. you walk up stairs into the back and can walk down a swing ladder if you wish. excellent baked goods!

	</p>

	<p> </p>
	<br>

	<p> 
		- the milkman, edinburgh, scotland, uk. right near the diagon-alley-like street of edinburgh with outdoor seating to enjoy some excellent espresso/matcha lattes while looking at old-timey scottish streets.
	</p>
	<p>
		- lannan bakery, edinburgh, scotland, uk. the tiniest little coffeeshop/bakery that will always have a line outside it, is dog-friendly, has excellent lattes/baked goods and also has very aesthetic looking prints and merch. big recommend!
	</p>

	<p>
		- the wall, edinburgh, scotland, uk. nick took us here! aesthetically rustic indoor seating with doughnuts, sandwiches and very good espresso lattes.
	</p>


	<p> </p>
	<br>

	    <p>
		 - moody coffee roasters, chamonix, france. went here twice pre-hike in the french alps and it never disappoints. excellent espresso or matcha lattes and uniquely themed french baked goods.

	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		- cafe bretelles, strasbourg, france. the tiniest little cafe with such good lattes and breakfast selections. bonus point that it is next to a cool little historic swing bridge that you can cross every 15 minutes or so when it's not rotating over the river.
		    
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		- buddy buddy, paris, france. an interesting nut-butter inspired coffeeshop that actually works so well with every drink i've tried. both matcha and espresso!

	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		- bel horizon, paris, france. the most aesthetic-looking coffee mugs i have ever seen and the lattes were excellent.
		    
	    </p>


	<p> </p>
	<br>

	    <p>
		- le moineau masque, montreal, canada. very good espresso lattes. french newspapers lying on every table that we tried, and failed, to do a crossword in, but overall a very adorable atmosphere.
		    
	    </p>
	    <p>
		- cafe la maison smith, quebec city, canada. such a good latte! a bench overlooks a part of historic square/buildings in old quebec city which was snow covered and so fun to look at from our little coffeeshop bench with warm lattes.
		    
	    </p>

	<p> </p>
	<br>
	
	<p>
		- el pendulo, mexico city, mexico. a three story bookstore with coffeeshop areas throughout and very good lattes! books almost entirely in spanish but definitely worth a visit even if you know close to nothing of the language.
	</p>
	<p>
		- raku in pasaje parian, mexico city, mexico. walk through this tree lined alley to reach the most aesthetic coffee shop with the best matcha i have ever had. they give you a different/tailored little bar of chocolate that goes with each drink. so fun!
	</p>

	<p>
		- otrocafe, mexico city, mexico. really good matcha and regular lattes. they also make their own cookies that are interestingly unique (and rotating) so always a fun surprise.
	</p>
	<p>
