      <h1>Coffeeshops</h1>
	<p></p>
	<img src="figs/pr1.png" alt="pr" width="300">
	<p>
- ceremony, providence, rhode island, usa. easily the best strawberry matcha (made with real fruit, making it extremely not gross and syrupy like strawberry drinks tend to be), very good regular oat lattes, and an interestingly subtle black sesame latte. pretty much anything on the menu is excellent!
- seven sisters, providence, rhode island, usa. oat lattes are great!</p>
	<p>
- daves coffee, providence, rhode island, usa. the "coffee milk latte" is a classic rhode island-er drink but also a regular latte is very good! also excellent breakfast sandwiches and avocado toasts and baked goods.</p>
	<p>
- bolt coffee, providence, rhode island, usa. really good espresso and matcha lattes. bonus point that one of the locations is inside the risd museum for a cool and cultural art experience.</p>
	<p>
- little city coffee, providence, rhode island, usa. tiny little coffeeshop with very good espresso lattes and baked goods! fun fact is that this was opened by dave (from above)'s very own brother. potentially because of some family dispute in classic provdence restaurant business style.</p>
	<p>
  </p>
	<p>
- tatte, boston, massachussetts, usa. the house latte is a middle-eastern inspired cardamom-y cinnamon-y warmly spiced latte, that even if a little too sweet for my liking, i highly recommend trying.</p>
	<p>
- blue bottle. [san francisco, la, san diego, dc, boston], usa. becoming a fairly popular chain, but very good quality espresso and lattes! also the chocolate-based drinks are surprisingly dark and intense and very very good.</p>
	<p>
- ogawa, boston, massachussetts, usa. impressive latte art, excellent matcha and the chocolate-based drinks (mocha, hot chocolate etc) are what everyone talks about. everything very good in general!</p>
	<p>
- the well, boston, massachussetts, usa. tiny little nonprofit cafe with very good lattes!</p>
	<p>
- tradesman, boston, massachussetts, usa. such a fun interior! mostly a sit-down rather than a pure good-old coffeeshop, but everything is very good!</p>
	<p>
</p>
	<p>
- golden goat, san francisco, california, usa. the golden turmeric latte is their famous thing to get (that i did not get because i cannot get myself to drink turmeric) but a normal espresso latte here is excellent. nick tomlin's rec!</p>
	<p>
- philz, [san francisco, davis, mtv, boston], usa. i know this is a chain but philz is actually so good! the mint mojito is excellent if you can stomach something sweet, and the mocha tesora is a really great dark mocha. a regular iced/hot latte is also always good!</p>
	<p>
- four barrel coffee, san francisco, california. usa. really good quality lattes! the decor is very plant themed which is fun to be in.</p>
	<p>
- pachamama, davis, california, usa. coffee beans from smallholder coffee farms and (often) latin american inspired drinks and such good lattes overall! always fun/interesting seasonal specials.</p>
	<p>
- mishkas, davis, california, usa. impressively large selection of lattes and drip coffee (just a regular is very good though) and a selection of baked goods that are usually pretty good. plus a gelato store right next door!</p>
	<p>
</p>
	<p>
- ozo coffee, boulder, colorado, usa. really good matcha and espresso lattes, and, if you sit outisde, you get rewarded with a view of the flatirons!</p>
	<p>
- boxcar coffee, boulder, colorado, usa. great lattes plus mountains through the windows.</p>
	<p>
- roothouse coffee, pagosa springs, colorado, usa. excellent lattes, cinnamon buns, and rustic log-cabin-y vibes. plus if you sit on the deck outside it overlooks the hotsprings and the rockies behind so you really could not ask for a better view or coffee experience.</p>
	<p>
- raisin rye, del norte, colorado, usa. such good lattes and every baked good looked incredible! mary's recommendation (these never fail us, really).</p>
	<p>
</p>
	<p>
- frequency, london, uk. good quality espresso and latte making! the second location (in angel) also has very good baked goods.</p>
	<p>
- jolene, london, uk. the tiniest little store with only a small seelction of baked goods laid out on a table to grab and excellent lattes!</p>
	<p>
- ozone, london uk. such good quality lattes! been told that the chai latte is also excellent.</p>
	<p>
- kiss the hippo, london, uk. tiny little cart by the canal but very good coffee. they also have the coolest merch, largely because everything is hippopotamus themed and therefore impossible to not be adorable.</p>
	<p>
- hermanos, london, uk. i didn't realise this was a chain and started to really like getting their lattes everytime i was freezing/walking back home. so i will keep this one here in solidarity of great coffee and that one barista that i now know really well.</p>
	<p>
- redemption roasters, london, uk. really good espresso and cool history of the place and hires.</p>
	<p>
- the box, stroud, lake district, uk. tiny little boxcar that pulls up with an impressive espresso making collection. such good lattes!</p>
	<p>
- knoops, london, uk. mostly hot chocolate, in any minute percentage you want (!!), but you can also get mochas and lattes that are all excellent.</p>
	<p>
</p>
	<p>
- el pendulo, mexico city, mexico. a three story bookstore with coffeeshop areas throughout and very good lattes! books almost entirely in spanish but definitely worth a visit even if you know close to nothing of the language.</p>
	<p>
- raku cafe, mexico city, mexico. really great quality espresso lattes and they give you a different/tailored little bar of chocolate that goes with each drink. so fun!</p>
	<p>
- pasaje parian, mexico city, mexico. walk through this tree lined alley to reach the most aesthetic coffee shop with the best matcha i have ever had. everything else looked so good too!</p>
	<p>
- otrocafe, mexico city, mexico. really good matcha and regular lattes. they also make their own cookies that are interestingly unique (and rotating) so always a fun surprise.</p>
	<p>
