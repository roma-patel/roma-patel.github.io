      <h1>Books</h1>
      <p>What these were meant to be were few-word summaries -- picked-apart and illuminating phrases of the main takeaways of the book in question. </p>
	<p>But fewer words are hard to come by, and this may mean that I do not, by Hemingway's standards, know what every writer should know, but I think the ones below nicely put together the amount of information I would need to recollect and re-encounter what reading these made me feel.</p>   
	<p></p>
	<img src="figs/pr1.png" alt="pr" width="300">
	<p>The version that I saw first also had extensive video lectures, tutorials and article/paper references, which I cannot seem to find, but when I do, it will go under the first resource list. Enjoy!</p>
	<p>the ocean at the end of the lane by neil gaiman. magical, child-like and dark, with too-picturesque descriptions of strange artifacts (but also wonderfully comforting - is this just me and reminescense of childhood - descriptions of the house). this is equal parts fantasy and horror and innocence and immorality; and although I can see this being a YA or children's book; I would not, in good faith, recommend this to an eleven year old.  </p>
	<p>lolita by nabokov. incestuous and disturbing but still beautifully written.  
</p>
	<p> the secret garden by frances hodgson burnett. brave new world by aldous huxley. anna karanenina by leo tolstoy. the catcher in the rye by jd salinger. fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury. heidi by johanna spyri. slaughterhouse five by kurt vonnegut. looking for alaska by john green (yes, despite, everything). alice's adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll. little women by louisa may alcott. tom sawyer by mark twain. catch 22 by joseph heller. the metamorphosis by franz kafka. watchmen by alan moore. v for vendetta by alan moore. the sandman by neil gaiman. animal farm by george orwell. a clockwork orange by anthony burgess. hansel and gretel by the brothers grimm. the jungle book by rudyard kipling. ethan frome by edith wharton. daisy miller by henry james. to kill a mockingbird by harper lee, the outsiders by se hinton, everyday by david levithan, 
 </p>
	<p>TODO; from a scattered book list   </p>
	<p> from childhood: delirium, the hunger games, harry potter, the lord of the rings, the chronicles of narnia, percy jackson (hmm), eragon, malory towers, st. clair (everything enid blyton!), scarlett, artemis fowl, animorphs, the outsiders, the book thief, meg cabot mediator stories, betrated (vampire night school), the perks of being a wallflower, the art of getting by, everything john green, a series of unfortunate events, the wind in the willows, what katy did, 
 </p>
	<p> cathy cassidy (irish lands, a dark horse and scarlett ribbons in the woods; strange gingerbread recipes, the sailboat on the river with the strange, musical gypsy boy, the startlingly vivid red fox in the woods; the winter near the lake in a new school, the kitten and the mean brother; the graffitied walls in london, the beautiful girl and hopelessly ill-matched boy, the therapist and unfolding of stories as nights spent painting walls slowly slip away; the caravan, the music, the magic of the wilderness and rusticness of it all)   </p>
	<p> jacqueline wilson (the hidden girl in the attic reading anne frank; the british fairground and christmastime with gifts until everything falls apart; the glass-blown garden in london, the unexpected scariness and drinking and death; the teenage trio; the lottery and abusive father; the tower and the story of the dead girl in the school; the art project in the victorian house; the eating disorder, the trip to wales in the dismal log cabin, the rain-ruined christmas and nadine's modeling incident with the creepy men), meg cabot.
 </p>
	<p> stories slipping away: the alternate personality british story, the carnival with the kidnapped twins, the delirium fanfiction plot twist, the man on the mountain who survived the cold with the far-away fire (from school literature)    </p>
