      <h1>Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</h1>

	<p></br></br></p>
	<p>John Koenig has spent the last seven years studying and defining neologisms to characterise the power and intensity of the emotions we feel but cannot adequately express through words. These words and their carefully crafted descriptions bring to life the transient, yet somewhat irrevocable, emotions that humans feel and ground them in the words we use to fill in the missing links in language.</p>

	<p>Here is a short introduction to some of the words, with links below to the entire dictionary for those who want to explore.</p>
	<p></br></br></br></p>

		<p><small>Aside: It's not so much the word itself, its derivational form or morphology, but the way that it is described; how it firmly grounds both emotion and language with this almost coherent imagistic aspect, allowing you to understand a feeling you may not have felt yet. And it would be great if we could use this computationally but is NLP there yet? Can it ever be?</small></p>


	<p><strong><em>kuebiko</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a state of exhaustion inspired by an act of senseless violence, which forces you to revise your image of what can happen in this world—mending the fences of your expectations, weeding out invasive truths, cultivating the perennial good that’s buried under the surface—before propping yourself up in the middle of it like an old scarecrow, who’s bursting at the seams but powerless to do anything but stand there and watch.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>adronitis</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> frustration with how long it takes to get to know someone—spending the first few weeks chatting in their psychological entryway, with each subsequent conversation like entering a different anteroom, each a little closer to the center of the house—wishing instead that you could start there and work your way out, exchanging your deepest secrets first, before easing into casualness, until you’ve built up enough mystery over the years to ask them where they’re from, and what they do for a living.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>silience</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the kind of unnoticed excellence that carries on around you every day, unremarkably—the hidden talents of friends and coworkers, the fleeting solos of subway buskers, the slapdash eloquence of anonymous users, the unseen portfolios of aspiring artists—which would be renowned as masterpieces if only they’d been appraised by the cartel of popular taste, who assume that brilliance is a rare and precious quality, accidentally overlooking buried jewels that may not be flawless but are still somehow perfect.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><em><strong>sonder</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>onism</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the frustration of being stuck in just one body, that inhabits only one place at a time, which is like standing in front of the departures screen at an airport, flickering over with strange place names like other people’s passwords, each representing one more thing you’ll never get to see before you die—and all because, as the arrow on the map helpfully points out, <i>you are here.</i></small></p>
	<p></p>


	<p><strong><em>flashover</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the moment a conversation becomes real and alive, which occurs when a spark of trust shorts out the delicate circuits you keep insulated under layers of irony, momentarily grounding the static emotional charge you’ve built up through decades of friction with the world.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>rigor samsa</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a kind of psychological exoskeleton that can protect you from pain and contain your anxieties, but always ends up cracking under pressure or hollowed out by time—and will keep growing back again and again, until you develop a more sophisticated emotional structure, held up by a strong and flexible spine, built less like a fortress than a cluster of treehouses.</small></p>
	<p></p>


	<p><strong><em>lachesism</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the desire to be struck by disaster—to survive a plane crash, to lose everything in a fire, to plunge over a waterfall—which would put a kink in the smooth arc of your life, and forge it into something hardened and flexible and sharp, not just a stiff prefabricated beam that barely covers the gap between one end of your life and the other.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>the meantime</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the moment of realization that your quintessential future self isn’t ever going to show up, which forces the role to fall upon the understudy, the gawky kid for whom nothing is easy, who spent years mouthing their lines in the wings before being shoved into the glare of your life, which is already well into its second act.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>occhiolism</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the awareness of the smallness of your perspective, by which you couldn’t possibly draw any meaningful conclusions at all, about the world or the past or the complexities of culture, because although your life is an epic and unrepeatable anecdote, it still only has a sample size of one, and may end up being the control for a much wilder experiment happening in the next room.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>amber</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a kind of melancholic trance in which you become completely absorbed in vivid sensory details—raindrops skittering down a window, tall trees leaning in the wind, clouds of cream swirling in your coffee—briefly soaking in the experience of being alive, an act that is done purely for its own sake.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>opiated</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the ambiguous intensity of looking someone in the eye, which can feel simultaneously invasive and vulnerable—their pupils glittering, bottomless and opaque—as if you were peering through a hole in the door of a house, able to tell that there’s someone standing there, but unable to tell if you’re looking in or looking out.</small></p>
	<p></p>


	<p><strong><em>mal de coucou</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a phenomenon in which you have an active social life but very few close friends—people who you can trust, who you can be yourself with, who can help flush out the weird psychological toxins that tend to accumulate over time—which is a form of acute social malnutrition in which even if you devour an entire buffet of chitchat, you’ll still feel pangs of hunger.</small></p>
	<p></p>


	<p><strong><em>nodus tollens</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the realization that the plot of your life doesn’t make sense to you anymore—that although you thought you were following the arc of the story, you keep finding yourself immersed in passages you don’t understand, that don’t even seem to belong in the same genre—which requires you to go back and reread the chapters you had originally skimmed to get to the good parts, only to learn that all along you were supposed to choose your own adventure.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>vellichor</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the strange wistfulness of used bookstores, which are somehow infused with the passage of time—filled with thousands of old books you’ll never have time to read, each of which is itself locked in its own era, bound and dated and papered over like an old room the author abandoned years ago, a hidden annex littered with thoughts left just as they were on the day they were captured.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>gnossienne</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a moment of awareness that someone you’ve known for years still has a private and mysterious inner life, and somewhere in the hallways of their personality is a door locked from the inside, a stairway leading to a wing of the house that you’ve never fully explored—an unfinished attic that will remain maddeningly unknowable to you, because ultimately neither of you has a map, or a master key, or any way of knowing exactly where you stand.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>nighthawk</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a recurring thought that only seems to strike you late at night—an overdue task, a nagging guilt, a looming and shapeless future—that circles high overhead during the day, that pecks at the back of your mind while you try to sleep, that you can successfully ignore for weeks, only to feel its presence hovering outside the window, waiting for you to finish your coffee, passing the time by quietly building a nest.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>Rückkehrunruhe</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> the feeling of returning home after an immersive trip only to find it fading rapidly from your awareness—to the extent you have to keep reminding yourself that it happened at all, even though it felt so vivid just days ago—which makes you wish you could smoothly cross-dissolve back into everyday life, or just hold the shutter open indefinitely and let one scene become superimposed on the next, so all your days would run together and you’d never have to call cut.</small></p>
	<p></p>

	<p><strong><em>midsummer</strong></em></br>
	<small><i>n.</i> a feast celebrated on the day of your 26th birthday, which marks the point at which your youth finally expires as a valid excuse—when you must begin harvesting your crops, even if they’ve barely taken root—and the point at which the days will begin to feel shorter as they pass, until even the pollen in the air reminds you of the coming snow.</small></p>
